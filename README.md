# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-App
This Kotlin app's primary purpose is to recognize the handwritten digits. The digits are drawn on a blackboard provided in the app.

A Convolution Neural Netwrok is used to make inferences. The CNN is trained on the MNIST dataset and the model can predict only single digit.

This app is an experiment to optimize the TensorFlow model using the TennsorFlow optimizer and to realize the optimized model using the Kotlin libray.
